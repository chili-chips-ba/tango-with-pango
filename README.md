The first Pango chip we shall play with is **PGL25G** from the Logos family, featuring 25K LUT5. Logos family is pin-compatible with Xilinx Spartan7 LUT6 silicon. It is interesting that Pango LUT5-based achitecture is mid-ground beetween LUT4 and LUT6 camps.

PGL25G near pears, at least on paper, are GowinSemi Arora [**GW2AR-18**](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/product/detail/38) (20K LUT4) and CologneChip [**GateMateA1**](https://colognechip.com/programmable-logic/gatemate/#tab-313423) (20K LUT8-tree). This project seeks to compare them in real-life apps, establishing their practical worth in terms of useable capacity and Fmax.
