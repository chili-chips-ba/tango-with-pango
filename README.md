# Tango with Pango

This is our sandbox for shaking out [PangoMicro](https://www.pangomicro.com/en) FPGAs.

The first Pango chip to try is **PGL25G** (25K LUT5) from their Logos family, which is pin-compatible with Xilinx Spartan7 LUT6 silicon. Gowin [Arora](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/product/detail/38) GW2AR-18 (20K LUT4) and CologneChip [GateMateA1](https://colognechip.com/programmable-logic/gatemate/#tab-313423) (20K 8-input LUT-tree) are its near-peers on paper. This project will establish their practical useability in terms of capacity, max utilization and Fmax.
